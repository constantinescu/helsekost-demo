Project Story - Made with ❤️ by Marina Constantinescu

This project started from a simple, real-world moment:
When a local shop, Øbro Helsekost Rehabilitering Klinik, closed in my neighborhood, I asked the owners if they had a website where I could find them again in the future.
They didn't — but they gave me their business card.

The design is built around:

    🎨 A color palette inspired by the clinic’s original business card

    📸 A nature-themed hero image (captured during a personal walk)

    ℹ️ Public information collected from their official Facebook page

Project Objectives

    My goal was to design a welcoming, professional page that could serve as their digital presence if they choose to use it later.
    
    Create a static site that can be expanded later into a dynamic site (with blog, booking system, database, etc.)

Deployment

The project is currently hosted via GitHub Pages: 👉 View Live Website (https://constantinescu.github.io/helsekost-demo/)
